DeskLights2
===========

Version 2 of the DeskLights project, more flexible, but not as easy

This version is meant to be uploaded to an Arduino Uno with a built in or attached ethernet shield.
It uses a more advanced method of controlling the lights that is compatible with the widely available ws2801 powered light strands.

More info will be included here soon...This is a late night checkin before day 2 of the Maker Faire and I wanted something available.
